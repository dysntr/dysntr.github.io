# Creating a Docusaurus Blog

## Introduction

There are many different blog platforms out there. The objective was to pick a blogging platform that was to meet the following requirements:

* Popular (so that there are plenty of documentations on it)
* Low overhead (Quick to setup and maintain)
* Allow for articles to be written in Markdown
* Have menu and toolbar for organization
* Have static-site generator feature (Web3/IPFS Deployment optionality)
* Easy to Blog and showcase portfolio projects
* Clean layout

This article details the step for setting up a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/getting-started) website with blog and showcase portfolio pages.

## Walkthrough

### Step 1 - Verify Requirements {#requirements}

NodeJS 16.14 or above is required (`node -v` can be used to check version) to setup Docusaurus. **Node.js** can be downloaded here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Step 2 - Install Docusaurus {#install}

The following command will install the `classic` theme docusaurus website. Replace `my-website` with the name of the website project (eg. dysntr.github.io). 

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```
For more details refer to this [link](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).

### Step 3 - Running the Development Server {#run-server}

The following command starts a local webserver that serves the docusaurus website.

```bash
cd my-website
npm start
```
The website can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Step 4 - Setup the Config {#config}

The website config needs to be added to `docusaurus.config.js` file. For full details refer to this [link](https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration).

Here are some of the information you need to setup the config:

:::note
**title**: Website title (eg. `Dysan\'s Site`)

**tagline**: Website tagline (eg. `A place to document discoveries and projects`)

**url**: `https://dysntr.github.io/`

**favicon**: Link for the favicon (eg. `img/favicon.ico`)

**projectName**: Usually your repo name (eg. `dysntr.github.io`)

**organizationName**: Usually your GitHub org/user name (eg. `dysntr`).

**deploymentBranch**: The branch to generate the static pages to (eg. `deploymentBranch: 'gh-pages',`)

**presets docs/blog editUrl**: Link to the github repo (eg. `https://github.com/dysntr/dysntr.github.io`)

**themeConfig:navbar**: navigation bar config ( eg. `title: 'Home'`, `href: 'https://github.com/dysntr/dysntr.github.io'`)

**themeConfig:footer**: footer config (eg. twitter settings `href: 'https://twitter.com/dysntr'`, github settings `href: 'https://github.com/dysntr/dysntr.github.io'` )

**themeConfig:copyright**: copyright config (eg. `Copyright Â© ${new Date().getFullYear()} Dysan Inc. Built with Docusaurus.`)

:::

Full config for this site can be found [here](https://github.com/dysntr/dysntr.github.io/docusaurus.config.js).


### Step 5 - Cleaning Up the Default Website

Some of the default pages and articles need to be cleaned up to finish the website.

Here are some of the things this section covers:

* Rename the Tutorial section to "Documentation"
* Move all the default tutorials to "Docusaurus Website Tutorials" Menu
* Remove the default authors, and add yourself to authors
* Remove the default blog articles, and this article as a blog article 
* Clean up the Home page

#### Rename the Tutorial section to "Documentation"

Update `docusaurus.config.js` file to modify the top menu bar.
There are two places in `docusaurus.config.js` that `Tutorial` needs to be changed to `Documentations`.

1. Under `themeConfig:navbar:items:label:` change `Tutorial` to `Documentations`
2. Under `themeConfig:footer:links:items:label:` change `Tutorial` to `Documentations`

#### Move all the default tutorials to "Docusaurus Website Tutorials" Menu

Change the file and folder structures to modify the left toolbar.

1. Create a new folder `\Website\docs\docusaurus-website-tutorials` where "Website" is your project name.
2. Copy _category_.json file from `tutorial-basics` to the new folder, and update label and description to `"Docusaurus Website Tutorials"`, and position to 2.
3. Move `\docs\tutorial-basics`, `\docs\tutorial-extras` and `intro.md` to this new folder.
4. Create a `intro.md` in `docs` folder with following content:

```
---
sidebar_position: 1
---
# Introduction
```

The left toolbar of the website will look something like this:

![](.\img\image01.png)

#### Remove the default authors, and add yourself to authors
The author file allows blog artciles to reference a specific author in the article. The file includes things like name, title, url, image_url. 

To add yourself, edit the `.\blog\authors.yml` file. Change one of the authors to yourself and delete the others. The thing to note is that, your github profile picture can be accessed via the link `https://github.com/<username>.png` (eg. `https://github.com/dysntr.png`). 

#### Remove the default blog articles, and this article as a blog article 

To create a blog article, create a new folder under `\blog` folder. Follow the naming convention `date-articlesubject` eg.`06-27-2022-creating-a-docusaurus-blog`.

Every blog article has a Markdown file. At the top of the file, a file descriptor header needs to be included. Here is an example

```
---
slug: creating-a-docusaurus-blog
title: Creating a Docusaurus Blog
authors: Dysan
tags: [website, blog, docusaurus]
---
```

Place the above header in `index.md` file under `\blog\06-27-2022-creating-a-docusaurus-blog` folder.

Delete all the other blog files and folders under `\blog` folder.

Add whatever you like to `index.md` as this will be the first blog article for the website.

#### Cleanup the Home page

The Home page is the first that shows up when a user visits the website URL. This page is located at `./Website/src/pages/index.js`

Change the button name from `Docusaurus Tutorial - 5 min` to `Check out the Blog!`.

Change the button link to take users to the blog page, i.e. `to="/blog/">`.

Remove `<HomepageFeatures />` from the page, this can be added later once additional customization have been completed.

### Step 6 - Deploy to GitHub Pages

This step will provide the steps to deploy the website to Github pages.

:::note
Each GitHub repository is associated with a GitHub Pages service. If the deployment repository is called my-org/my-project (where my-org is the organization name or username), the deployed site will appear at https://my-org.github.io/my-project/. Specially, if the deployment repository is called my-org/my-org.github.io (the organization GitHub Pages repo), the site will appear at https://my-org.github.io/. [Source](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)
:::

First, create the github repository `dysntr.github.io`, where `dysntr` is the user/org name. Commit and push your first commit using the following commands:

``` bash
git init
git add *
git commit -m "first commit" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/dysntr/dysntr.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
```

To deploy the website run `GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> yarn deploy` eg. `GIT_USER=dysntr yarn deploy`

For more details on deployment refer to [link](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment).

## Conclusions

This article provided the steps required to setup and deploy a basic blog website to Github pages. 

## Future Things to Do

Future work to be considered for this project are:
* Additional blog customizations and personalization (colors, background images, fonts, etc.).
* Adding project portfolio showcase.
* Deploying the website to IPFS and setting up ENS.
